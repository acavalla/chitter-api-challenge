# chitter-api-challenge

This is the chitter api challenge from [Makers Academy](https://github.com/Makers-Academy), in which the backend is hosted on Heroku [here](https://chitter-backend-api-v2.herokuapp.com/), and the task is to build an API connection and front end to interact with the backend with various http requests.

The main purpose of this for me is to get more familiar with fetch, promises, and async functions.
